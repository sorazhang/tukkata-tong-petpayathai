            <h2>About Somchai</h2>
            <p>
                Over 10 years coaching Muay Thai at every level - from complete beginners learning 
                their first stance to professional fighters preparing for championship bouts. From 
                rural gyms in Thailand to international training camps. Each fighter teaches you 
                something different, and after thousands of rounds, patterns emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
                This journey started in a small gym in rural Thailand. Not as a fighter looking 
                for glory, but as someone who found themselves drawn to the teaching side of 
                martial arts. There's something about watching someone struggle with a concept, 
                then suddenly understand it - not just the movement, but the reason behind it. 
                That's what kept me in the gym day after day, year after year.

            <h2>The Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Most gyms teach techniques. They show you how to throw a jab, how to check a kick, 
                how to clinch. And that's important - you need the fundamentals. But there's a 
                deeper layer that often gets missed: the strategic thinking, the principles that 
                explain why techniques work, the fighter's intelligence that separates someone who 
                knows moves from someone who understands fighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's what this site focuses on. Not the basic how-to instructions - you can find 
                those anywhere. This is about the wisdom that comes from experience. The insights 
                that help you understand what you're doing and why. The kind of knowledge that 
                changes how you see every aspect of Muay Thai.

            <h2>Why Share This Knowledge?</h2>
            <p>
                Because good information should be accessible. Because too many people train for 
                years without understanding the deeper principles. Because the martial arts community 
                benefits when experienced coaches share what they've learned.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't about building a brand or selling courses. It's about contributing to 
                the knowledge base of Muay Thai. If these articles help even a few fighters or 
                coaches understand the art at a deeper level, that's worthwhile.
